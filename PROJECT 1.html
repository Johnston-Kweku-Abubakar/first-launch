    <p id="p1">
      Ever since I became conversant with ICT tools, coding has been one thing I
      wished and dreamt of knowing how to do. Now it is becoming reality.<br />
      Coding brings me joy and living this dream is like something else. I will
      not hesitate to tutor others in HTML Below are some basic info of HTML and
      CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML, short for hyper-text markup language is said to be the building
      block of all websites. HTML is A set of tags and rules (conformingÂ to
      SGML) for using them in developing hypertext documents. SGML, is Standard
      Generalized markup language. <br>HTML is made up of elements and element
      content. The elements are made up of opening tags and closing tags. An
      opening tag goes like &lt;HTML&gt;, and the closing tag being
      &lt;/HTML&gt;. The contentcomes between the opening and closing tags.
      <strong>NOTE: Not all html elements have closing tags.</strong>. Other
      elements include; &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;,&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;,
      etc. You will get to know so many other elements as time goes on. The
      photos below (details) show the code and the preview of the page
      respectively. By subscribing to the youtube chanel using the link above,
      you can learn html to the core as this is just to help you understand the
      very basics. Here

    <h3 id="section-css" title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</h3>
    <p>
     <bdo> Your webpage or site needs to look good right, this is where CSS comes in.
      CSS is short for Cascading StyleSheet. This has to do with the appearance
      of some or all of the content or layout of the page, depending on
      developer's preferences. With just HTML, the website would not look
      pleasing to the eye. The site would then need some styling and this is
      where CSS comes in. The "style" tag is used to indicate CSS elements. The
      style tag appears inside the head tag. (&lt;head&gt;). The style element
      comes in the form;<br />
      &lt;style&gt; <br />h1 (to specify first heading) { <br />color: blue<br />
      }

    <h4>JAVASCRIPT</h4>
    <p id="demo">
      Websites sure do need to be fun and interactive. This is where JAVASCRIPT
      comes in.
      </p>
      
      <button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Learn HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT with ease" '>
        Click to change
      </button>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.fontSize='40px'">
Can't see? Click me
</button>
      <br /><p>
      Javascript is used in Html files to make them more fun and interactive.
      <br>For example, Javascriptcan make the background of a site such that when clicked, the color will change.
      So for the above button which changed the <br>content of the paragraph before it,<br>
      we have, &lt;button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Learn HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT with ease" '&gt;
      Click to change&lt;/button&gt;.<br> So you need to take note of the format of the code above. The only things that depend on the user are
      <ol><li>demo(which is acting as the id/identification for the button)</li>
      <li>And the value of the innerHTML attribute</li></ol>
      <br/>  You can learn Javascript further by clicking the link;
